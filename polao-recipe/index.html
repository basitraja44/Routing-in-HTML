    <h1>Pakistani Chicken Pulao (Yakhni Pulao)</h1>
    <p>Presenting a classic Yakhni Chicken Pulao recipe that’s truly hard to mess up! This recipe promises deep flavor,
        tender chicken, and fluffy rice. It’s also easy to double so you can serve it to guests with confidence. Tested
        to perfection!</p>

    <p>Slowly but lovingly, I’ve been chipping away at this Chicken Pulao recipe for years. Pulao (also spelled Pilau),
        a delicately spiced <u>rice dish</u>, is a tad behind (truthfully, very far behind) <u>Chicken Biryani</u> in popularity. A
        Houston restaurant owner once told me he’d have to throw out the Pulao every night because nobody would pick it
        over Biryani.</p>
